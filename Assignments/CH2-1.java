/**
Design a program that will ask the user to enter the amount of a purchase.
The program should then compute the state sales tax and the county sales tax. 
Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent of the purchase amount, the county sales
tax is 2 percent of the purchase amount. The program should display the amount of
the purchase, the state sales tax, the county sales tax, the total sales tax,
and the total of the sale (which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax)
Hint: Use 0.04 for 4 percent, 0.02 for 2 percent in the calculation.
