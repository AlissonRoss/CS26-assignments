/*
The loan officer at one of the Central Mountain Credit Unionâ€™s branch offices has asked
you to write a loan amortization application to run on her desktop PC. The application
should allow the user to enter the amount of a loan, the number of years of the loan, and
the annual interest rate. An amortization report should then be saved to a text file

Payment = (loan x rate/12 x term) / term - 1
Loan = the amount of the loan
Rate = the annual interest rate
Term = (1 + Rate/12)^Years x 12
