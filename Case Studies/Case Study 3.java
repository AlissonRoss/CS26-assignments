/*
The National Commerce Bank has hired you as a contract programmer. Your first assignment
is to write a class that will be used by the bank’s automated teller machines (ATMs)
to validate a customer’s personal identification number (PIN). Your class, which will be
named PinTester, will be incorporated into a larger program that asks the customer to
input his or her PIN on the ATM’s numeric keypad. (PINs are multi-digit numbers. The
program stores each digit in an element of an int array.) The program also retrieves a
copy of the customer’s actual PIN from a database, as an int array. If these arrays match,
then the customer’s identity is validated.
